## Credits

### Author & Contributors

The author of the BootstrapComponents extension is Tobias Oetterer.

Translations have been provided by the members of the [Translatewiki.net
project](https://translatewiki.net).

### Dependencies

The BootstrapComponents extension uses several other libraries. These,
while not included directly in, nor delivered with the code, are pulled
in automatically by the Composer tool during installation. They are:
* mediawiki Bootstrap extension by Stephan Gambke. See Extension:Bootstrap
  on [mediawiki.org](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Bootstrap)
  and [GitHub](https://github.com/cmln/mw-bootstrap)
* loads of other software that I either forgot, am not aware of or that should
  be obvious (e.g. PHP, MediaWiki, etc.)

### Thanks!

My thanks go to Stephan Gambke for creating the Bootstrap extension and to
JeroenDeDauw and especially mwjames who both where kind enough to help me
getting better in coding for mediawiki projects.

If I forgot somebody, sorry. Please drop me a note, so I can add them here.
