## Credits

### Author & Contributors

The author of the BootstrapComponents extension is Tobias Oetterer.

It is based upon the [Bootstrap extension][ExtensionBootstrap] created
by Stephan Gambke. Also, some parts of its documentation is copied and
used here.

Code snippets used for CI on [Travis] and [Scrutinizer] were taken from
the [SemanticScribunto] software repository.

Integration tests use the JsonTestCaseScriptRunner class created by
mwjames for [SemanticMediaWiki] and both json test classes are adaption
of his work, also.

### Dependencies

The BootstrapComponents extension uses the Bootstrap extension by
Stephan Gambke which is installed automatically during installation via
Composer. This extension utilizes several other libraries and modules.
See its documentation on [mediawiki.org][ExtensionBootstrap] and
[GitHub][GitHub].

### Thanks!

My thanks go to Stephan Gambke for creating the Bootstrap extension and to
JeroenDeDauw and especially mwjames who both where kind enough to help me
getting better in coding for mediawiki projects.

If I forgot somebody, sorry. Please drop me a note, so I can add them here.
